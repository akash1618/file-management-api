Task: Building a File Management API

Introduction: The goal is to create a simple file management API using Node.js. The API should allow users to upload, list, and delete files. Additionally, implement file categorization functionality.

Requirements:

**Code Structuring:**

- Organize the project into appropriate directories and files.
- Implement a clear folder structure for routes, controllers, and utilities.
- Follow a consistent naming convention.

**Optimization:**

- Implement file upload and deletion efficiently.
- Minimize unnecessary code execution.
- Utilize async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Handle errors gracefully.

**Responsibility Division:**

- Divide the application into well-defined and reusable modules.
- Implement SOLID principles for better maintainability.
- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling.

**Architecture:**

- Define a clear architecture for the application (e.g., routing, controllers).
- Use middleware for common functionalities (e.g., error handling, logging).

**Data Flow:**

- Ensure a unidirectional data flow within the application.
- Use advanced serialization techniques for efficient data exchange.
- Implement streaming for large file operations.

**Data Storage:**

- Store file data in a local directory.
- Implement basic server-side storage for user's file data.
- Implement data encryption for sensitive information.

**Latest Tools and Libraries:**

- Use the latest stable version of Node.js.
- Implement routing using Express.js.
- Utilize a middleware for handling file uploads (e.g., multer).

**Bonus:**

- Implement file versioning.
- Add authentication for API endpoints.
- Implement file search functionality.
